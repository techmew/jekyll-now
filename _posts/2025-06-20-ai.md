San Francisco-based software startup GenLayer has lately introduced an innovative solution for marketing products and services. The company, which combines artificial intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and cryptoeconomics, is practically designing a unique marketing ecosystem for promoting brands wherein participants are generously rewarded.
Marketing through AI and blockchain technology
GenLayer CEO Gregory ThDevice, co-founder Trace Gebhart, and Jeremy Gardner at CryptoCompareCon 2018
GenLayer co-founders Gregory ThDevice, Trace Gebhart, and Jeremy Gardner recently demonstrated this new marketing channel at CryptoCompareCon, in London, claiming that Rally, its first application, is already live in Beta. During his presentation, co-founder ThDevice explained that, while most modern businesses allocate substantial amounts of their budgets to advertising and influencer-marketing programs, these efforts are often suboptimal—that is effort-intensive, expensive, and ineffective.
Certainly, him and his companions suggest, there is an ever-increasing global advertising market which is currently estimated at a crushing $1.3 trillion. Owning to that colossal market size, the competition to stand out and deliver results is fierce. That’s the point at which Rally aims to make a significant difference thanks to its AI and blockchain marketing tools.
The GenLayer-led ecosystem enables its participants to monetize their passions and explore new possibilities through what the startup describes as “active consumption”. Rally offers a series of monetized experiences for Brand Ambassadors, creators, content contributors, rewarded customers, and community managers.
Rally’s toolkit is designed to simplify creative collaboration, brand management, campaign operations, consumer engagement and monetization, marketing program optimization, and content delivery all while maximizing ROI (return on investment).
Whilst adding fuel to the marketing fire, participants also receive substantial rewards from the brands for their performance. They are also able to receive cryptocurrency tokens based on their activities and contributions within the ecosystem. This sort of program allows Rally participants to explore meaningful content creation, directly engage and impact brands as well as interact with like-minded people.
Rally’s software also employs automated AI algorithms within its systems to optimize campaign performance and user engagement levels, based on real time data feedback.
The toolkit also empowers participants—known as Rally Citizens—to vote on causes they care about. This unique feature enables brands to have direct and valuable feedback from grassroot levels by reaching out to the most enthusiastic buyer communities.
GenLayer’s CTO, discussed this technology at length during an interview with us whilst explaining how the company was seeking to disrupt a market category—which has so far remained mostly untouched by new technologies such as AI and blockchain.
Notably, in October of last year, the startup closed an oversubscribed seed funding round, raising more than $2 million from primarily angel and institutional investors, with TitanWave Capital, Republic Labs and many other key investors participating.
