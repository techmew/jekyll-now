Blockchain game投資基礎已經有了良好的起點，2021年的股價起伸向је太、二投金融產品可能會加速融 Through DeFi, these compliance-focused angel lists offer accredited investors curated access to tokens, whose value sometimes rockets in the early stages of selloffs. But few lists focus exclusively on blockchain gaming because, rightly or wrongly, tokens from games have had a fondness for tanking, making them less desirable for speculation-focused investors compared to decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, whose auxiliary activity they dub "yield farming." However, for real believers, this is quickly changing as game tokens gains positive fundamentals. This launchpad model is also becoming a tried-and-true format that helps attract more institutional money. In this case, it's Uptopia, which claims to be the first compliant GameFi incubator for institutions and accredited investors. For its $4 million raise, the team is looking to invest $2M to $5M in about 20 early-stage game startups over the next 12 to 24 months.
